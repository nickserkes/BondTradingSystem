# BondTradingSystem
All of the objects have been created and and will run from the provideed text files with threading.
A mini version of prices and of market data were included because 1000000 entries was too large to be uploaded to github.
Using the CMakeLists.txt and the terminal command: rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && (cd .. && ./build/trading_system)
I am getting the program to run and write to the appropriate files
